  abstract = {In the Lady in the Lake scenario, a mobile agent, ùêø, is pitted against an agent, ùëÄ, who is constrained to move along the perimeter of a circle. ùêø is assumed to begin inside the circle and wishes to escape to the perimeter with some finite angular separation from ùëÄ at the perimeter. This scenario has, in the past, been formulated as a zerosum differential game wherein ùêø seeks to maximize terminal separation and ùëÄ seeks to minimize it. Its solution is well-known. However, there is a large portion of the state space for which the canonical solution does not yield a unique equilibrium strategy. This paper provides such a unique strategy by solving an auxiliary zero-sum differential game. In the auxiliary differential game, ùêø seeks to reach a point opposite of ùëÄ at a radius for which their maximum angular speeds are equal (i.e., the antipodal point). ùêø wishes to minimize the time to reach this point while ùëÄ wishes to maximize it. The solution of the auxiliary differential game is comprised of a Focal Line, a Universal Line, and their tributaries. The Focal Line tributaries' equilibrium strategy for ùêø is semi-analytic, while the Universal Line tributaries' equilibrium strategy is obtained in closed form.},

  abstract = {This paper establishes a concise definition for an Engagement Zone which describes a region of space for which a Mobile Agent must alter its current motion strategy or otherwise risk engaging with a known Threat. In the event of an engagement, the Mobile Agent may have to actively evade the Threat in order to guarantee survival. Provided the Engagement Zone definition, several fundamental engagement models are described and their corresponding Engagement Zones are derived. In each of the engagement models, the Mobile Agent is treated as an Evader; they include pursuit-evasion against a range-limited Pursuer moving with simple motion and faster speed, a variation in which the Pursuer is slower, and a turret-evasion scenario against a range-limited, turn-rate-limited Turret. The slow Pursuer Engagement Zone is applied to a path planning scenario wherein the Mobile Agent must reach a desired target in minimum time while navigating outside the dynamically changing Engagement Zone. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage of Engagement Zone-based navigation over other path plans based on circumnavigation.},

@misc{weintraub2024deterministic,
  abstract = {Previous methods for avoiding dynamic engagement zones leverage the calculus of variations to obtain optimal path plans for avoiding risk and reaching a desired target location [1,2]. While this method is deterministic; it scales poorly as the number of engagement zones increases. Furthermore, it is inherently sensitive to initial guesses and finding local minimums can be problematic. This talk presents a novel approach that uses deterministic approaches to obtain a set of feasible flight plans for reaching the desired destination and reports when no such plan exists. Furthermore, it uses an efficient scheme for feeding initial guesses to a nonlinear program solver that provides flyable path plans that mitigate risk. Lastly, a tool is developed that measures the risk of the flight path for avoiding a large field of engagement zones, providing useful information to improve battle management.
The solution process begins with using the location of each weapon engagement zone and associated model to obtain a Voronoi partition of the environment. This partitioning is used to construct a feasibility graph signifying navigation through each pair of weapon engagement zones. Once constructed each edge of the graph borders two opposing weapon engagement zones for which the target vehicle aims to navigate between. If the pair of engagement zones can not be penetrated due to the distance and size of those zones; then the associated edge of the graph is deleted. This process is iteratively performed until each edge has been evaluated. Upon completion of the feasibility graph, path plans are attained using graph-based search to minimize the time of arrival. Next, the provided solution is fed to a nonlinear program solver that smooths the solution or solutions from the feasibility path according to the vehicle dynamics. The resulting solutions are analyzed through a simplified simulation to assess risk and time of arrival. 
Presented are the methods used to solve this navigational problem, results of the simulated trajectories, and future research directions.

@misc{milutinovic2024stochastic,
  abstract = {Description: Recent efforts in planning paths for a vehicle around dynamic engagement zones have been based upon optimal control solved via nonlinear program comprised of a pseudospectral direct collocation of the dynamics and constraints. The engagement zone(s) rotate and scale based upon the position and aspect angle of the vehicle, respectively. Initially, the problem setup was based upon a vehicle navigating around a stationary, gimballed threat to reach a specified goal position; the entire engagement took place on a 2D plane [1]. As a follow-on effort, two dynamic engagement zones were considered along with an added vehicle turning-rate constraint [2]. In all of these works, the solution consisted of a single optimal trajectory associated with a particular initial condition. In this presentation, three extensions are considered and demonstrated: 1) stochasticity via the inclusion of a Wiener process (Brownian motion) in the dynamics, 2) computation of an optimal feedback control law, and 3) multiple engagement zones (even beyond 2). The stochastic process may represent uncertainty due to wind, other environmental factors, or position measurement errors. In the case of a single engagement zone the stochastic process may represent the vehicle's uncertainty about the location of the engagement zone. Regarding the feedback control law, this is a much more powerful result than a single path plan as it requires that the control law be computed once, a priori, and can then be used for any position in the state space, whereas the existing path plan-based solutions require re-computation for each new position in the state space. Having the feedback control law and Value function everywhere is also illustrative of the overall behavior of optimal trajectories \textendash{} e.g., some optimal trajectories fly around while others fly between neighboring engagement zones. Lastly, the methodology can be applied to larger numbers of engagement zones. When based on Value iteration [3], the Value function computation scales at least sub-exponentially with the number of engagement zones.

  abstract = {This investigation seeks to obtain estimates on the intercept time associated with a fast Pursuer implementing Pure Pursuit against a Target whose trajectory is a circular arc. The analytical solution of the kinematic equations of motion is not feasible and thus the baseline approach for computing the intercept time is numerical simulation, i.e., numerical integration of the kinematics. This method can obtain the intercept time in (essentially) real time for a single Pursuer against a single Target. Here, the goal is to estimate the intercept time using orders of magnitude less computational time. Although not explicitly explored in this work, the purpose of such approximations is to make feasible the rapid evaluation of Pursuer-to-Target assignments in a massive many-on-many engagement scenario wherein the intercept time may be a key measure. Several approximation methods are proposed here and their merits (or lack thereof) are demonstrated through simulation. Ultimately, assuming the Target is not actually turning may be suitable when its turn radius is relatively large, while assuming intercept occurs at the closest point on the turn circle may be suitable when its turn radius is relatively small.},

The virtual targets serve as an intermediary target for the pursuers, allowing the pursuers to delay their final assignment to the evaders. However, upon reaching the virtual target, the pursuers must decide which evader to capture. It is assumed that there are more pursuers than evaders and that the pursuers are faster than the evaders. The objective is two-part: first, assign each pursuer to virtual target and evader such that the the pursuer team's energy is minimized, and second, choose the the virtual targets' locations for this minimization problem. The approach taken is to consider the Apollonius geometry between each pursuer's virtual target location and each evader. Using the constructed Apollonius circles, the pursuer's travel distance and maneuver at a virtual target are obtained. These metrics serve as a gauge for the total energy required to capture a particular evader and are used to solve the joint virtual target selection and pursuer-evader assignment problem. This paper provides a mathematical definition of this problem, the solution approach taken, and an example.},

Arbitrary numbers of intruders are released at the circumference of the environment at arbitrary time instants and locations.

Specifically, the turret has a finite engagement range and can only turn (clockwise or anti-clockwise) in the environment with fixed angular rate whereas, the vehicle has a finite capture radius and can move in any direction with unit speed.

Specifically, we establish necessary conditions on the parameter space to guarantee finite competitiveness of any online algorithm.

@article{dillon2023optimal,
  abstract = {The work herein expresses an optimal control problem for an air vehicle to reach a desired location through two dynamic keep out zones. In today's contested world, there are many instances where air vehicles are denied a portion of the airspace when trying to reach a desired target. Under these conditions the objective is to find the optimal route to the desired location while obeying path constraints. In this work, the path constraint is defined as the enemy's ground weapon engagement zone, and is established in a way that simulates an anti-aircraft defense system. The vehicle's objective is to reach the desired location in minimum time while completely avoiding the engagement zone. This optimal control problem is considered in the Cartesian plane, has a fixed final state, and free final time. The dynamics of the aircraft are a function of the aircraft's velocity and heading. The velocity of the aircraft is assumed to be constant and the vehicle's control is its heading rate. The engagement zone, which acts as a path constraint, is dynamic in that its effective range is a function of the engagement zone's instantaneous line of sight angle and the aircraft's instantaneous bearing angle. The desired final location is defined to be a point opposite the engagement zone from the aircraft's initial location. Several scenarios are conducted to show path trajectories through multiple dynamic engagement zones. Results illustrate how aircraft dynamic maneuvers can minimize total flight time to a target while maintaining a safe distance from enemy threats. Further, while investigating multiple engagement zones, it is shown that an aircraft can maintain safe separation from multiple overlapping threats by manipulating relative bearing angles and the aircraft's heading.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a zero-sum differential game is formulated and solved in which a mobile Evader seeks to escape from within a circle at whose origin lies a stationary, turn-constrained Turret. The scenario is a variant of the famous Lady in the Lake game in which the shore-constrained Pursuer has been replaced with the Turret. As in the former, it is assumed that the Turret's maximum angular rate is greater than the linear velocity of the Evader. Since two outcomes are possible, a Game of Kind arises - either the Evader wins by reaching the perimeter of the circle, or the Turret wins by aligning with the latter's position. A barrier surface partitions the state space into two regions corresponding to these two outcomes and a Game of Degree is solved within each region. The solutions to the Games of Degree are comprised of the Value functions (i.e., the equilibrium value of the cost/utility as a function of the state) and the saddle-point equilibrium control policies for the two players. Like the Lady in the Lake game, the equilibrium policy of the Evader is not uniquely de‚ÄÄned where it has angular rate advantage over the Turret. Unlike the Lady in the Lake game, the losing region for the Evader is present for all speed ratios, and there is an additional semi-permeable surface separating center- and shore-bound Evader trajectories. The solution depends heavily upon the speed ratio of the agents; in particular, there are two speed ratio regimes with distinctive solution structures.},

@article{vonmoll2022pure,
  abstract = {The study of pursuit curves is valuable in the context of air-to-air combat as pure pursuit guidance (heading directly at the target) is oftentimes implemented. The problems considered in this paper concern a Pursuer, implementing pure pursuit (i.e., line of sight guidance), chasing an Evader who holds course. Previous results are applicable to the case in which capture is defined as the two agents being coincident, i.e., point capture. The focus here is on obtaining results for the more realistic case  where the pursuer is endowed with an effector whose range is finite. The scenario in which the Evader begins inside the Pursuer's effector range is also considered (i.e., escape from persistent surveillance, among other potential applications). Questions herein addressed include: does the engagement end in head-on collision or tail chase, will the Evader be captured or escape, what is the minimum distance the Pursuer will attain, for two Pursuers, is simultaneous capture/escape optimal and, if so, what is the optimal heading for the Evader (max time to capture, or min time to escape), and the feasibility for a fast Evader to escape from many Pursuers. Where possible, closed-form, analytic results are obtained, otherwise attention is given to computability with an eye towards real-time, on-board implementation.},

@thesis{vonmoll2022skirmish-level,
  abstract = {Supremacy in armed conflict comes not merely from superiority in capability or numbers but from how assets are used, down to the maneuvers of individual vehicles and munitions. This document outlines a research plan focused on skirmish-level tactics to militarily relevant scenarios. Skirmish-level refers to both the size of the adversarial engagement -- generally one vs. one, two vs. one, and/or one vs. two -- as well as the fact that the goal or objective of each team is well-established. The problem areas include pursuit-evasion and target guarding, either of which may be considered as sub-problems within military missions such as air-to-air combat, suppression/defense of ground-based assets, etc. In most cases, the tactics considered are comprised of the control policy of the agents (i.e., their spatial maneuvers), but may also include role assignment (e.g, whether to act as a decoy or striker) as well as discrete decisions (e.g., whether to engage or retreat). Skirmish-level tactics are important because they can provide insight into how to approach larger scale conflicts (many vs. many, many objectives, many decisions). Machine learning approaches such as reinforcement learning and neural networks have been demonstrated to be capable of developing controllers for large teams of agents. However, the performance of these controllers compared to the optimal (or equilibrium) policies is generally unknown. Differential Game Theory provides the means to obtain a rigorous solution to relevant scenarios in the form of saddle-point equilibrium control policies and the min/max (or max/min) cost / reward in the case of zero-sum games. When the equilibrium control policies can be obtained analytically, they are suitable for onboard / real-time implementation. Some challenges associated with the classical Differential Game Theory approach are explored herein. These challenges arise mainly due to the presence of singularities, which may appear in even the simplest differential games. The utility of skirmish-level solutions is demonstrated in (i) the multiple pursuer, single evader differential games, (ii) multi-agent turret defense scenarios, and (iii) engage or retreat scenarios. In its culmination, this work contributes differential game and optimal control solutions to novel scenarios, numerical techniques for computing singular surfaces, approximations for computationally-intensive solutions, and techniques for addressing scenarios with multiple stages or outcomes.},

@article{vonmoll2022lock-evade,
  abstract = {In this paper we model and analyze a scenario in the two-dimensional plane involving a mobile Attacker and stationary Defender. There are two possibilities for termination: the Attacker can collide with the Defender (engagement) or maneuver to a safe zone away from the Defender (retreat). The Defender is equipped with a directional turret, which it can rotate with a bounded rate. If the turret is aligned with the Attacker's position, the Defender has a lock on the Attacker and may choose to fire on the Attacker. Thus, whether engaging or retreating, the Attacker has incentive to evade the turret's line of sight and thereby avoid being locked-on. In the case of retreat, if lock-on occurs the Defender cooperates with the Attacker by withholding fire to allow the Attacker to retreat. However, if the Attacker chooses to engage and lock-on occurs, the Defender will open fire on the Attacker. We model the scenario as a set of differential games with different cost functionals depending on the type of termination. The agents are assumed to have full state information. In the case that the Defender can lock onto the Attacker the pre- and post-lock portions of the game are solved individually and combined together. Otherwise, the Attacker can terminate the game prior to lock-on and the game is comprised of a single stage. The equilibrium strategies are derived in each case, and a partitioning of the state space wherein a particular goal selection is optimal is constructed.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates obstacle-free simple motion pursuit-evasion problems where the pursuer is faster and game termination is point capture. It is well known that the interior of the Apollonius Circle (AC) is the evader's dominance region, however, it was unclear whether the evader could reach outside the initial AC without being captured. We construct a pursuit strategy that guarantees the capture of an evader within an arbitrarily close neighborhood of the initial AC. The pursuer strategy is derived by reformulating the game into a nonlinear control problem, and the guarantee holds against any admissible evader strategy. Our result implies that the evader can freely select the capture location, but only inside the initial AC. Therefore, a class of problems, including those where the payoff is determined solely based on the location of capture, are now trivial.},

The intruders are arbitrarily released at the circumference of the environment and move radially toward the perimeter with fixed speed. We present a competitive analysis approach to this problem by measuring the performance of multiple online algorithms for the vehicle against arbitrary inputs relative to an optimal offline algorithm that has access to all future inputs. In particular, we first establish a necessary condition on the parameter space to guarantee finite competitiveness of any algorithm and then characterize parameter regime in which one must expect a competitive ratio of at least 2. We then design and analyze three online algorithms and characterize parameter regimes for which they have finite competitive ratios. Specifically, our first two algorithms are provably 1, and 2-competitive, respectively, whereas our third algorithm exhibits a finite competitive ratio that depends on the problem parameters. Finally, we provide numerous parameter space plots providing insights into the relative performance of our algorithms.},

Second, the min-time strategy which avoids the engagement zone entirely is considered. Third, the min-time strategy which allows for some time in the engagement zone; but, still strives to stay away from the center of the engagement zone is posed. Lastly, a fixed final-time strategy is considered, wherein the target tries to avoid the engagement zone; but, is required to arrive at the desired location at a specific time.

The Runner distracts the Turret and ends up being neutralized in order that the Penetrator can be guaranteed to hit the target circle.  We formulate the Turret-Runner-Penetrator scenario as a differential game over the Value of the subsequent game of min/max terminal angle which takes place between the Turret and Penetrator once the Runner has been neutralized.  The solution to the Game of Degree, including equilibrium Turret, Runner, and Penetrator strategies, as well as the Value function are given.  The case in which the Penetrator can reach the target before the Turret can neutralize the Runner is formulated and solved.

Using the calculus of variations the optimal control problem for the defender which maximizes the amount of time that the pursuer is inside his area of effect is posed and solved. In the event that the evader is captured by the pursuer before the pursuer escapes the area of effect of the defender, some suboptimal strategies of the defender provide equivalent contact time.

These defensive assets inflict a cost on the attacker as a function of distance and allow the defender to present a deterrent in an effort to persuade the attacker to elect retreat. The solution of the game is constructed by examining two related subproblems: the Game of Engagement (GoE) and the Optimal Constrained Retreat (OCR). Each subproblem examines a different combination of attacker termination strategies, capture vs retreat, and defender strategies, resist vs cooperate. When solving for the optimal constrained retreat strategy, a value function constraint is imposed on the retreat trajectory in order to ensure that the attacker does not maneuver into an advantageous position.

@inproceedings{vonmoll2020evolutionary,
  abstract = {In this paper a scenario is considered in which a group of predators cooperate to maximize the number of prey captures over a finite time horizon on a two-dimensional plane. The emphasis is on developing predator strategies, and thus the behavior of the prey agents is fixed to a Boids-like flocking model which incorporates avoidance of nearby predators. At each time instant, the predators have control authority over their heading angle; however, we restrict the headings to be governed by one of five different pre-specified behaviors. No communication occurs between the predator agents - each agent determines its own control without knowledge of what the other predators will implement; thus, the predator strategies are fully decentralized. The full state space of the system is collapsed to a set of features which is independent of the number of prey. An evolutionary algorithm is used to evolve an anchor point controller wherein the anchor point lies in the feature space and has a particular predator behavior associated, thus providing a candidate solution to the question of "what to do when". The two predator case is the focus in this work, although the ideas could be applied to larger groups of predators. The strategies resulting from the evolutionary algorithm favor aiming at the nearest prey mostly, and also avoiding having the predators getting too close and then pursuing the same prey. Thus useless behaviors are generally not present among the elite at the end of the evolutionary process.},

  abstract = {Thermal management has emerged as one of the primary challenges for modern military gas turbine engines. Fuel actuator pumping systems contribute to the challenge by constantly injecting waste heat into the fuel system. This is due to a fundamental mismatching between an actuation system with a low duty cycle and a pump which is always running. Since the pump is directly coupled to the gearbox, the detriment is twofold: horsepower is always being drawn to drive the pump, and heat is generated. Furthermore, the emergence of variable cycle engines pushes the actuation system in the direction of more effectors and more loads, which drives requirements for high pressure and high flows from the pumping system. Piston pumps have been seen as favorable for the actuation pump application due to their high single stage pressure rise capability. However reducing the number of pumping components alone has not solved the thermal management issue. Variable displacement pumps have been designed to operate over a range of conditions in order to deliver flow more appropriately as demanded by the control system. These pumps allow pressure and flow to be modulated independent of one another and of the pump's rotational speed. Variable displacement pumps may be considered as a component of a partial-demand actuation pumping system. Even in a partial-demand actuation pumping system, a variable displacement pump will still be coupled to the gearbox and require some minimum flow for lubrication and cooling. On-demand actuation fuel systems deliver only the amount of flow that is being demanded at a given time so that waste heat is minimized. In other words, the duty cycle of the pumping system matches that of the actuation system. The development of an on-demand actuation fuel system will require a new architecture and new components.},

Perhaps the most touted benefit of a DECS is the potential to reduce the amount of harnessing which connects throughout the engine. Such a system is comprised of several network sections incorporating control nodes or data concentrators (DCs). These DCs contain control logic to perform control function computations and are connected to the full authority digital engine control (FADEC) via a high-speed data communication bus. A novel approach for analyzing and evaluating three topologies\textendash{}ring, star, and bus\textendash{}in the context of a relevant military engine was described.

These improvements will require a more efficient, more reliable, and more advanced propulsion system. The concept of smart components is built around actively controlling the engine and the aircraft to operate optimally. Usage of smart components intelligently increases efficiency and system safety throughout the flight envelope, all while meeting environmental challenges. This approach requires an integration and optimization, both at the local level and the system level, to reduce cost. Interactions between the various subsystems must be understood through the use of modeling and simulation. This is accomplished by starting with individual subsystem models and combining them into a complete system model. Hierarchical, decentralized control reduces cost and risk by enabling integration and modularity.

  abstract = {The exhaust gas temperature (EGT) is typically defined as the gas temperature at the exit of the turbine; the sensors used to measure this parameter are considered the most vulnerable elements of the entire turbine engine instrumentation. EGT measurement is considered a key parameter for optimizing fuel economy, diagnosis, and prognosis. The reason is that turbine blade temperature is a good indicator for normal life consumption of that blade. Currently, direct sensor measurements made on turbine modules are limited due to the extremely hot environment. Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) sensors located downstream from the highest temperature sections provide a means to roughly infer the temperatures seen by the turbine blades/disks. But these sensors, which themselves are subject to frequent failures, provide a fairly inaccurate indication of the actual metal temperature profiles. This is of particular importance for high performance military turbine engines where the margin between hot-section operating conditions and material limitations is shrinking. A future state is envisioned that would use emerging pyrometric, fiber optic, and laser-based sensing to accurately assess the condition and life usage of the hot section, on a blade-by-blade basis.},

In general, the optimal length of the walk is not known, so this method (like the exact methods) assume some fixed length. Exact methods for solving the problem have recently been put forth, however, in the absence of additional heuristics, the exact method scales poorly for problems with more than 10 sites or so. By using a genetic algorithm, performance and computation time can be traded off depending on the application. The main contributions are a novel chromosome encoding scheme and genetic operators for cyclic walks which may visit sites more than once.

UAVs offer an attractive alternative to supporting and defending various threats at borders. This article applies a differential game to define a border defense scenario where one UAV (pursuer) seeks to capture two intruders (evaders) before they reach a designated border. The evaders can be UAVs, marine/ground vehicles, or human agents, but have a lower maximum speed than the pursuer throughout the game. Simple motion is assumed for the pursuer and evaders with complete state information shared across all agents.  The game is played within a rectangular area with a parallel top and bottom border of length L and left and right borders with a length of W, for a game aspect ratio of L/W. The value of the game is the minimum distance to the bottom border achieved by the evaders at any time before capture of both evaders. Within the region where the pursuer wins, the game of degree is explored and the optimal policy for both the evaders and pursuers is derived using geometric},

This report explores one particular area of interest: trajectory optimization. The Linear Quadratic Regulator and Linear Quadratic Gaussian algorithms are introduced as predecessors to the Iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian (iLQG) algorithm, which is re-derived in this report and demonstrated on 3 systems of interest: cartpole, double cartpole, and quadrotor. iLQG is robust and widely applicable to a vast number of different systems. Probabilistic Differential Dynamic Programming (PDDP) is introduced as an important extension to iLQG which incorporates uncertainty into the trajectory optimization process. The conceptual advances presented in this report were centered around the use of a Gaussian Process Regression Network (GPRN) to represent the unknown system dynamics in lieu of the standard Gaussian Process representation employed by PDDP. GPRNs offer a more sophisticated noise model and a more adaptive regression framework. More speciffcally, they incorporate input-dependent noise and signal correlation between multiple outputs. This should enhance the predictive capability of the algorithm to represent the unknown system dynamics. Work remains on fully incorporating GPRN into a PDDP-like algorithm: effort continues in the areas of understanding variational Bayes and variational message passing for learning GPRN hyperparameters, and in creating a MATLAB implementation.},

The players have simple motion \`{a} la Isaacs and the pursuers are faster than the evader. We confine our attention to the case where the pursuers have the same speed, so the game's parameter is the evader/pursuers speed ratio 0 < \mathrm{\mu} < 1. State feedback capture strategies and an evader strategy which yields a lower bound on his time-to-capture are devised using a geometric method. It is shown that in group/swarm pursuit, when the players are in general position, capture is effected by one, two, or by three critical pursuers, and this irrespective of the size N (> 3) of the pursuit pack.  Group pursuit devolves into pure pursuit by one of the pursuers or into a pincer movement pursuit by two or three pursuers who isochronously capture the evader, a m\`{e}nage \`{a} trois. The critical pursuers are identified. However, these geometric method-based pursuit and evasion strategies are optimal only in a part of the state space where a strategic saddle point is obtained and the Value of the differential game is established, and as such, are suboptimal. To fully explore the differential game's high dimensional state space and get a better understanding of group pursuit, numerical experimentation is undertaken. The state space region where the geometric method-based suboptimal solution of the group pursuit differential game is the optimal solution becomes larger the smaller the speed ratio parameter is.},

The data collection task is undertaken by a UAV which autonomously executes the mission. Each node has a priority/ weight associated with it that characterizes the relative importance between timely collection of data from the nodes. In this context, a prudent performance metric is the maximal weighted time between consecutive visits to each node. We wish to minimize the maximum of this metric among all nodes for a given cycle length. Here, the cycle length refers to the total number of nodes (including repeats) visited per cycle. When the cycle length is greater than the number of nodes, some nodes, arguably ones with a higher priority, will be visited more often. We pose the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), that computes the optimal visit sequence and number of visits to each node for a given cycle length. Not surprisingly, the exact method is not scalable with the number of nodes and the cycle length. We therefore present sub-optimal methods  by directly enforcing a pre-specified number of visits to each node. We present an iterative scheme that computes solutions for increasing cycle length with a recipe for updating the number of visits based on the solution from the previous iteration. We compare the optimal and sub-optimal iterative schemes and show that the sub-optimal scheme is an order of magnitude faster than the optimal scheme with minimal loss in performance.},

@inproceedings{weintraub2020maximum,
  abstract = {This paper considers a two agent scenario containing an observer and a non-maneuvering target. The observer is maneuverable but is slower than the course-holding target. In this scenario, the observer is endowed with a nonzero radius of observation within which he strives at keeping the target for as long as possible. Using the calculus of variations we pose and solve the optimal control problem, solving for the heading of the observer which maximizes the amount of time the target remains inside the radius of observation. Utilizing the optimal observer heading we compute the exposure time based upon the angle by which the target is initially captured. Presented, along with an example, are the zero-time of exposure heading, maximum time of observation heading, and proof that observation is persistent under optimal control.},

@inproceedings{pachter2019singular,
  abstract = {The Two Cutters and Fugitive Ship game posed by Isaacs is revisited again. We discuss and analyze the singular configuration of this two-pursuer one-evader differential game. This paper addresses the question of whether or not either player has the ability to exploit the dispersal surface. Specifically, we in- vestigate the case where the Evader effectively stands still (e.g., by dithering in a small neighborhood). We show that the canonical optimal pursuit policy yields chattering in the discrete-time version of the game. As the timestep approaches zero, the capture time approaches the Value of the game, and thus the Evader is not penalized for standing still. Implications on related scenarios are discussed.},

@article{vonmoll2019robust,
  abstract = {Analysis of the pursuit-evasion differential game consisting of multiple pursuers and single evader with simple motion is difficult due to the wellknown curse of dimensionality. Policies have been proposed for this scenario, and we show that these policies are Global Stackelberg equilibrium strategies.  However we also show that they are not saddle point equilibria in the feedback sense. The argument is twofold: there are cases where the saddle point condition is violated, and cases where the strategy profiles are not time consistent (subgame perfect). The issue of capturability is explored, and sufficient conditions for guaranteed capture are provided. A new pursuit policy is proposed which guarantees capture while also providing an upper bound for capture time. The Evader policy corresponding to the Global Stackelberg equilibrium is shown to provide a lower bound for capture time. Thus these policies are robust from the Pursuer and Evader perspectives, respectively, should they implement them. Several other interesting pursuit and evasion policies are explored and compared with the robust policies in a series of experiments.},

The Pursuers are faster than the Evader and the three player have simple motion/are holonomic. Coincidence of the Evader with either one, or both Pursuers, is capture, and time of capture is the payoff/cost. In this paper Isaacs' Two Cutters and Fugitive Ship differential game is revisited and the solution of the Game of Kind is provided. Using Isaacs' geometric method, explicit formulae for the players' optimal state feedback strategies and the Value of the game are derived. The merits of the suboptimal Evader tactic of reducing speed, or opting to stay stationary, are examined.},

@inproceedings{vonmoll2020optimalevasion,
  abstract = {The Pure Pursuit strategy is ubiquitous both in the control literature but also in real-world implementation. In this paper, we pose and solve a variant of Isaacs' Two Cutters and Fugitive Ship problem wherein the Pursuers' strategy is fixed to Pure Pursuit, thus making it an optimal control problem. The Pursuers are faster than the Evader and are endowed with a finite capture radius. All agents move with constant velocity and can change heading instantaneously. Although capture is inevitable, the Evader wishes to delay capture as long as possible. The optimal trajectories cover the entire state space. Regions corresponding to either solo capture or isochronous (dual) capture are computed and both types of maximal time-to-capture optimal trajectories are characterized.},

@inproceedings{vonmoll2018pursuit-evasion,
  abstract = {In this paper, we extend the well-studied results of the two-pursuer, single-evader differential game to any number of pursuers. The main objective of this investigation is to exploit the benefits of cooperation amongst the pursuers in order to reduce the capture time of the evader. Computational complexity is a chief concern as this problem would need to be solved in an online fashion, e.g. in the case of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles. A new geometric approach to solving the game is introduced and analyzed, which changes the problem of optimizing over continuous domains to a discrete combinatoric optimization. While past efforts at solving multiple pursuer problems have suffered from the curse of dimensionality, the geometric algorithms put forth here are shown to be scalable. Categorization and removal of redundant pursuers is the primary means by which scalability is achieved. The solution of this problem serves as a stepping stone to more complex problems such as the M-pursuer N-evader differential game.},

@article{vonmoll2019multi-pursuer,
  abstract = {We consider a general pursuit-evasion differential game with three or more pursuers and a single evader, all with simple motion. It is shown that traditional means of differential game analysis is difficult for this scenario. But simple motion and min-max time to capture plus the two-person extension to Pontryagin's maximum principle imply straight-line motion at maximum speed which forms the basis of the solution using a geometric approach. Safe evader paths and policies are defined which guarantee the evader can reach its destination without getting captured by any of the pursuers, provided its destination satisfies some constraints. A linear program is used to characterize the solution and subsequently the saddle-point is computed numerically. We replace the numerical procedure with a more analytical geometric approach based on Voronoi diagrams after observing a pattern in the numerical results. The solutions derived are open-loop optimal, meaning the strategies are a saddle-point equilibrium in the open-loop sense.},
