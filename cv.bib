@inproceedings{vonmoll2020evolutionary,
  abstract = {In this paper a scenario is considered in which a group of predators cooperate to maximize the number of prey captures over a finite time horizon on a two-dimensional plane. The emphasis is on developing predator strategies, and thus the behavior of the prey agents is fixed to a Boids-like flocking model which incorporates avoidance of nearby predators. At each time instant, the predators have control authority over their heading angle; however, we restrict the headings to be governed by one of five different pre-specified behaviors. No communication occurs between the predator agents - each agent determines its own control without knowledge of what the other predators will implement; thus, the predator strategies are fully decentralized. The full state space of the system is collapsed to a set of features which is independent of the number of prey. An evolutionary algorithm is used to evolve an anchor point controller wherein the anchor point lies in the feature space and has a particular predator behavior associated, thus providing a candidate solution to the question of "what to do when". The two predator case is the focus in this work, although the ideas could be applied to larger groups of predators. The strategies resulting from the evolutionary algorithm favor aiming at the nearest prey mostly, and also avoiding having the predators getting too close and then pursuing the same prey. Thus useless behaviors are generally not present among the elite at the end of the evolutionary process.},

The mobile Attacker seeks to reach the perimeter of the circular target, whereas the Defender(s) seeks to align itself with the Attacker, thereby ending the game.

This formulation is representative of a scenario in which the Attacker inflicts damage on the target as a function of its terminal distance. The state-feedback equilibrium strategies and Value functions for the Attacker-win and Defender(s)-win scenarios are derived for both the one- and two-Defender cases, thus providing a solution to the Game of Degree.

The target is cooperative, and its position, heading and speed are precisely known by the pursuing agent. The pursuing agent has nonholonomic motion constraints, and therefore the path traveled by the pursuing agent must satisfy the minimum turn radius constraints. We consider the class of Dubins paths as candidate solutions, and analyze the characteristics of the six modes of Dubins paths where the final position is restricted to lie on the target circle with heading in the tangential direction of the circle. For each Dubins mode, we derive the feasibility limits, discontinuities and local extrema. Using this analysis the intercepting paths are found by a systematic bisection search in the feasible regions of each of the Dubins modes. We prove that the algorithm outputs the optimal solution, if the optimal intercepting path is a Dubins path; otherwise, it outputs the best found intercepting path and a tight lower bound to the optimal solution.},

The solution of the game is constructed by examining two related subproblems: the Game of Engagement (GoE) and the Optimal Constrained Retreat (OCR). Each subproblem examines a different combination of attacker termination strategies, capture vs retreat, and defender strategies, resist vs cooperate. When solving for the optimal constrained retreat strategy, a value function constraint is imposed on the retreat trajectory in order to ensure that the attacker does not maneuver into an advantageous position.

In particular, we first establish a necessary condition on the parameter space to guarantee finite competitiveness of any algorithm and then characterize parameter regime in which one must expect a competitive ratio of at least 2. We then design and analyze three online algorithms and characterize parameter regimes for which they have finite competitive ratios. Specifically, our first two algorithms are provably 1, and 2-competitive, respectively, whereas our third algorithm exhibits a finite competitive ratio that depends on the problem parameters. Finally, we provide numerous parameter space plots providing insights into the relative performance of our algorithms.},

We construct a pursuit strategy that guarantees the capture of an evader within an arbitrarily close neighborhood of the initial AC. The pursuer strategy is derived by reformulating the game into a nonlinear control problem, and the guarantee holds against any admissible evader strategy. Our result implies that the evader can freely select the capture location, but only inside the initial AC.

@thesis{vonmoll2022skirmish-level,
  abstract = {Supremacy in armed conflict comes not merely from superiority in capability or numbers but from how assets are used, down to the maneuvers of individual vehicles and munitions. This document outlines a research plan focused on skirmish-level tactics to militarily relevant scenarios. Skirmish-level refers to both the size of the adversarial engagement -- generally one vs. one, two vs. one, and/or one vs. two -- as well as the fact that the goal or objective of each team is well-established. The problem areas include pursuit-evasion and target guarding, either of which may be considered as sub-problems within military missions such as air-to-air combat, suppression/defense of ground-based assets, etc. In most cases, the tactics considered are comprised of the control policy of the agents (i.e., their spatial maneuvers), but may also include role assignment (e.g, whether to act as a decoy or striker) as well as discrete decisions (e.g., whether to engage or retreat). Skirmish-level tactics are important because they can provide insight into how to approach larger scale conflicts (many vs. many, many objectives, many decisions). Machine learning approaches such as reinforcement learning and neural networks have been demonstrated to be capable of developing controllers for large teams of agents. However, the performance of these controllers compared to the optimal (or equilibrium) policies is generally unknown. Differential Game Theory provides the means to obtain a rigorous solution to relevant scenarios in the form of saddle-point equilibrium control policies and the min/max (or max/min) cost / reward in the case of zero-sum games. When the equilibrium control policies can be obtained analytically, they are suitable for onboard / real-time implementation. Some challenges associated with the classical Differential Game Theory approach are explored herein. These challenges arise mainly due to the presence of singularities, which may appear in even the simplest differential games. The utility of skirmish-level solutions is demonstrated in (i) the multiple pursuer, single evader differential games, (ii) multi-agent turret defense scenarios, and (iii) engage or retreat scenarios. In its culmination, this work contributes differential game and optimal control solutions to novel scenarios, numerical techniques for computing singular surfaces, approximations for computationally-intensive solutions, and techniques for addressing scenarios with multiple stages or outcomes.},

The focus here is on obtaining results for the more realistic case  where the pursuer is endowed with an effector whose range is finite. The scenario in which the Evader begins inside the Pursuer's effector range is also considered (i.e., escape from persistent surveillance, among other potential applications). Questions herein addressed include: does the engagement end in head-on collision or tail chase, will the Evader be captured or escape, what is the minimum distance the Pursuer will attain, for two Pursuers, is simultaneous capture/escape optimal and, if so, what is the optimal heading for the Evader (max time to capture, or min time to escape), and the feasibility for a fast Evader to escape from many Pursuers.

Fuel actuator pumping systems contribute to the challenge by constantly injecting waste heat into the fuel system. This is due to a fundamental mismatching between an actuation system with a low duty cycle and a pump which is always running. Since the pump is directly coupled to the gearbox, the detriment is twofold: horsepower is always being drawn to drive the pump, and heat is generated. Furthermore, the emergence of variable cycle engines pushes the actuation system in the direction of more effectors and more loads, which drives requirements for high pressure and high flows from the pumping system. Piston pumps have been seen as favorable for the actuation pump application due to their high single stage pressure rise capability. However reducing the number of pumping components alone has not solved the thermal management issue. Variable displacement pumps have been designed to operate over a range of conditions in order to deliver flow more appropriately as demanded by the control system. These pumps allow pressure and flow to be modulated independent of one another and of the pump's rotational speed. Variable displacement pumps may be considered as a component of a partial-demand actuation pumping system. Even in a partial-demand actuation pumping system, a variable displacement pump will still be coupled to the gearbox and require some minimum flow for lubrication and cooling. On-demand actuation fuel systems deliver only the amount of flow that is being demanded at a given time so that waste heat is minimized. In other words, the duty cycle of the pumping system matches that of the actuation system. The development of an on-demand actuation fuel system will require a new architecture and new components.},

The concept of smart components is built around actively controlling the engine and the aircraft to operate optimally. Usage of smart components intelligently increases efficiency and system safety throughout the flight envelope, all while meeting environmental challenges. This approach requires an integration and optimization, both at the local level and the system level, to reduce cost. Interactions between the various subsystems must be understood through the use of modeling and simulation. This is accomplished by starting with individual subsystem models and combining them into a complete system model. Hierarchical, decentralized control reduces cost and risk by enabling integration and modularity.

  abstract = {The exhaust gas temperature (EGT) is typically defined as the gas temperature at the exit of the turbine; the sensors used to measure this parameter are considered the most vulnerable elements of the entire turbine engine instrumentation. EGT measurement is considered a key parameter for optimizing fuel economy, diagnosis, and prognosis. The reason is that turbine blade temperature is a good indicator for normal life consumption of that blade. Currently, direct sensor measurements made on turbine modules are limited due to the extremely hot environment. Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) sensors located downstream from the highest temperature sections provide a means to roughly infer the temperatures seen by the turbine blades/disks. But these sensors, which themselves are subject to frequent failures, provide a fairly inaccurate indication of the actual metal temperature profiles. This is of particular importance for high performance military turbine engines where the margin between hot-section operating conditions and material limitations is shrinking. A future state is envisioned that would use emerging pyrometric, fiber optic, and laser-based sensing to accurately assess the condition and life usage of the hot section, on a blade-by-blade basis.},

Exact methods for solving the problem have recently been put forth, however, in the absence of additional heuristics, the exact method scales poorly for problems with more than 10 sites or so. By using a genetic algorithm, performance and computation time can be traded off depending on the application. The main contributions are a novel chromosome encoding scheme and genetic operators for cyclic walks which may visit sites more than once.

Simple motion is assumed for the pursuer and evaders with complete state information shared across all agents.  The game is played within a rectangular area with a parallel top and bottom border of length L and left and right borders with a length of W, for a game aspect ratio of L/W. The value of the game is the minimum distance to the bottom border achieved by the evaders at any time before capture of both evaders.

This report explores one particular area of interest: trajectory optimization. The Linear Quadratic Regulator and Linear Quadratic Gaussian algorithms are introduced as predecessors to the Iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian (iLQG) algorithm, which is re-derived in this report and demonstrated on 3 systems of interest: cartpole, double cartpole, and quadrotor. iLQG is robust and widely applicable to a vast number of different systems. Probabilistic Differential Dynamic Programming (PDDP) is introduced as an important extension to iLQG which incorporates uncertainty into the trajectory optimization process. The conceptual advances presented in this report were centered around the use of a Gaussian Process Regression Network (GPRN) to represent the unknown system dynamics in lieu of the standard Gaussian Process representation employed by PDDP. GPRNs offer a more sophisticated noise model and a more adaptive regression framework. More speciffcally, they incorporate input-dependent noise and signal correlation between multiple outputs. This should enhance the predictive capability of the algorithm to represent the unknown system dynamics. Work remains on fully incorporating GPRN into a PDDP-like algorithm: effort continues in the areas of understanding variational Bayes and variational message passing for learning GPRN hyperparameters, and in creating a MATLAB implementation.},

The data collection task is undertaken by a UAV which autonomously executes the mission. Each node has a priority/ weight associated with it that characterizes the relative importance between timely collection of data from the nodes. In this context, a prudent performance metric is the maximal weighted time between consecutive visits to each node. We wish to minimize the maximum of this metric among all nodes for a given cycle length. Here, the cycle length refers to the total number of nodes (including repeats) visited per cycle. When the cycle length is greater than the number of nodes, some nodes, arguably ones with a higher priority, will be visited more often. We pose the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), that computes the optimal visit sequence and number of visits to each node for a given cycle length. Not surprisingly, the exact method is not scalable with the number of nodes and the cycle length. We therefore present sub-optimal methods  by directly enforcing a pre-specified number of visits to each node. We present an iterative scheme that computes solutions for increasing cycle length with a recipe for updating the number of visits based on the solution from the previous iteration.

  abstract = {The Pure Pursuit strategy is ubiquitous both in the control literature but also in real-world implementation. In this paper, we pose and solve a variant of Isaacs' Two Cutters and Fugitive Ship problem wherein the Pursuers' strategy is fixed to Pure Pursuit, thus making it an optimal control problem. The Pursuers are faster than the Evader and are endowed with a finite capture radius. All agents move with constant velocity and can change heading instantaneously. Although capture is inevitable, the Evader wishes to delay capture as long as possible. The optimal trajectories cover the entire state space. Regions corresponding to either solo capture or isochronous (dual) capture are computed and both types of maximal time-to-capture optimal trajectories are characterized.},

@inproceedings{pachter2019singular,
  abstract = {The Two Cutters and Fugitive Ship game posed by Isaacs is revisited again. We discuss and analyze the singular configuration of this two-pursuer one-evader differential game. This paper addresses the question of whether or not either player has the ability to exploit the dispersal surface. Specifically, we in- vestigate the case where the Evader effectively stands still (e.g., by dithering in a small neighborhood). We show that the canonical optimal pursuit policy yields chattering in the discrete-time version of the game. As the timestep approaches zero, the capture time approaches the Value of the game, and thus the Evader is not penalized for standing still. Implications on related scenarios are discussed.},

@article{vonmoll2019robust,
  abstract = {Analysis of the pursuit-evasion differential game consisting of multiple pursuers and single evader with simple motion is difficult due to the wellknown curse of dimensionality. Policies have been proposed for this scenario, and we show that these policies are Global Stackelberg equilibrium strategies.  However we also show that they are not saddle point equilibria in the feedback sense. The argument is twofold: there are cases where the saddle point condition is violated, and cases where the strategy profiles are not time consistent (subgame perfect). The issue of capturability is explored, and sufficient conditions for guaranteed capture are provided. A new pursuit policy is proposed which guarantees capture while also providing an upper bound for capture time. The Evader policy corresponding to the Global Stackelberg equilibrium is shown to provide a lower bound for capture time. Thus these policies are robust from the Pursuer and Evader perspectives, respectively, should they implement them. Several other interesting pursuit and evasion policies are explored and compared with the robust policies in a series of experiments.},

@article{pachter2019two-on-one,
  abstract = {A three agent pursuit-evasion differential game in the Euclidean plane where two pursuers engage an Evader is considered. The Pursuers are faster than the Evader and the three player have simple motion/are holonomic. Coincidence of the Evader with either one, or both Pursuers, is capture, and time of capture is the payoff/cost. In this paper Isaacs' Two Cutters and Fugitive Ship differential game is revisited and the solution of the Game of Kind is provided. Using Isaacs' geometric method, explicit formulae for the players' optimal state feedback strategies and the Value of the game are derived. The merits of the suboptimal Evader tactic of reducing speed, or opting to stay stationary, are examined.},

@inproceedings{vonmoll2018pursuit-evasion,
  abstract = {In this paper, we extend the well-studied results of the two-pursuer, single-evader differential game to any number of pursuers. The main objective of this investigation is to exploit the benefits of cooperation amongst the pursuers in order to reduce the capture time of the evader. Computational complexity is a chief concern as this problem would need to be solved in an online fashion, e.g. in the case of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles. A new geometric approach to solving the game is introduced and analyzed, which changes the problem of optimizing over continuous domains to a discrete combinatoric optimization. While past efforts at solving multiple pursuer problems have suffered from the curse of dimensionality, the geometric algorithms put forth here are shown to be scalable. Categorization and removal of redundant pursuers is the primary means by which scalability is achieved. The solution of this problem serves as a stepping stone to more complex problems such as the M-pursuer N-evader differential game.},

@article{vonmoll2019multi-pursuer,
  abstract = {We consider a general pursuit-evasion differential game with three or more pursuers and a single evader, all with simple motion. It is shown that traditional means of differential game analysis is difficult for this scenario. But simple motion and min-max time to capture plus the two-person extension to Pontryagin's maximum principle imply straight-line motion at maximum speed which forms the basis of the solution using a geometric approach. Safe evader paths and policies are defined which guarantee the evader can reach its destination without getting captured by any of the pursuers, provided its destination satisfies some constraints. A linear program is used to characterize the solution and subsequently the saddle-point is computed numerically. We replace the numerical procedure with a more analytical geometric approach based on Voronoi diagrams after observing a pattern in the numerical results. The solutions derived are open-loop optimal, meaning the strategies are a saddle-point equilibrium in the open-loop sense.},
